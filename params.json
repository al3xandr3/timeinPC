{"name":"Time in PC","tagline":"A Windows application to keep track of time spent in computer.","body":"\r\n![Time in PC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/al3xandr3/timeinPC/master/timeinPC.png)\r\n\r\n### What it Does ?\r\n\r\nKeeps track and informs about the time spent in computer.\r\n\r\nIt runs on the Windows taskbar and when hovering mouse over it, it shows:\r\n- Day: Total time in PC for today, includes inactive periods during the day.\r\n- Active: Time Active in PC for today (excludes inactive periods).\r\n\r\nDuring a working day in computer there might be periods where we stop active use of PC (but are still working), for a meeting, a call, figure something out on paper, etc... So i think is useful to see both numbers: total time and just active time.\r\n\r\n### Data Export\r\n\r\nTo allow re-use of the data collected, it automatically exports on a daily basis into a csv file the data with a summary of the time spent on PC, by day:\r\n- Date: of the day\r\n- Active (minutes): Minutes active in Computer\r\n- Day start time\r\n- Day end time\r\n\r\n(Day end time - Day start time)  = gives the total time in PC for the day, the same number as we see in \"Day\" from the application icon.\r\n\r\nLook for timeinPC.csv in the same folder as timeinPC.exe\r\n\r\n### Running it\r\n\r\nRequires Microsoft Window and the .NET framework to be installed.\r\n\r\nCreate a shortcut of the timeinPC.exe into the Startup Applications folder, and let it run on background, no need to input any data or worry about it. \r\n\r\nStartup Applications folder: `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup`\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n$('aside#sidebar a.button').href = \"https://github.com/al3xandr3/timeinPC/releases/download/v1/timeinPC.v1.zip\";\r\n</script>","google":"UA-39542235-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
