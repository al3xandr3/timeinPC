{"name":"Time in PC","tagline":"A Windows application to keep track of time spent in computer.","body":"\r\n![Time in PC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/al3xandr3/timeinPC/master/timeinPC.png)\r\n\r\nIt runs on the taskbar and when hovering mouse over it, it shows:\r\n- Day: Total time in PC for today, includes inactive periods during the day.\r\n- Active: Time Active in PC for today (excludes inactive periods).\r\n\r\nDuring a working day in computer there might be periods where we stop active use of PC (but are still working), for a meeting, a call, figure something out on paper, etc... So i think is usefull to see both numbers: total time and just active time.\r\n\r\nTo allow re-use of the data collected, it exports to a csv file (timeinPC.csv), on a daily basis, a summary with the time spent on PC:\r\n- Date: of the day\r\n- Active (minutes): Minutes active in Computer\r\n- Day start time\r\n- Day end time\r\n\r\n(Day end time - Day start time)  = gives the total time in PC for the day, the same number as we see in \"Day\" from the application icon.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake it a Startup app**, and let it run on background, no need to input any data or worry about it.\r\n\r\n** Startup Folder: C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\r\n\r\n\r\n### Run Requirements\r\n- Microsoft Windows\r\n- .NET Framework\r\n\r\n### Development Requirements\r\n- F# .NET, open it up in Visual Studio and it should just work.\r\n- Packages:\r\n    + Install-Package System.Data.SQLite.Core\r\n    + Install-Package Costura.Fody\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-39542235-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
